								<p>The Giving Leader which began since 2017 is the donation program for individuals who agreed to donate 1 million KRW per year. 
								In April 2018, professor Jonghan Lim donated condolence money with his father’s name Hengdal Lim to someone without family as their 
								funeral fund, and in December, baseball player, Ahsub Son provided baseball equipment worth 200 million KRW to other baseball players 
								in Busan, so he became giving leader.</p>

								Sports players also actively participate in giving leader. LG shakers Basketball player Sirae Kim joined 2nd giving leader as players 
								in Gyeongnam on Septem￾ber 26, 2018. Being interested in the local community, he said, “I am really happy to donate fund to less privileged 
								people in local community through joining giving leader.” Also he said, “I will not only donate, but will also look into where the fund goes, 
								and I will be a person who can perform sharing happiness and value of giving.” The fund from Mr. Kim was invaluable to support living and medical 
								expenses of less privileged families.
