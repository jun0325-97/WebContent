								<p>Financial difficulties lead to cultural poverty. Despite the fact that cultural experience is a major activity 
								in which social diversity is experienced within daily life, it can virtually be a wall that cannot be crossed for 
								isolated group of people. Community Chest of Korea supported various projects for the expansion of opportunities 
								for cultural participation for the isolated group of people to improve their quality of life.</p>

								Hearing-impaired people who use sign language are hard to read tourist book and to read signboards. Hamy￾ang center 
								for an interpreter and Community Chest of Korea made sign language tourist map to help hearing-impaired people when 
								they take a trip. 10 hearing-impaired people in Hamyang selected 10 attractions near the city and took photos.
								Most of them engaged in agriculture, they actively participated despite the fact that it was farming season. 
								The map was distributed to the national the hearing-impaired as￾sociations, and even Jeju island suggested benchmarking. 
								Also, we opened the exhibition with the photos which were taken to make a map. So, the hearing-impaired people in Hamyang 
								contributed to the cultural activities for other dis￾abled.

								Taehyon National Rehabilitation Center is the fa￾cility where 200 severely handicapped people live. Most of them who are living 
								here are in their mid-30s, and they really wanted to participate in culture and art activities, but support for cultural 
								activities was not strong enough. This inspired Taeyeon Rehabilitation Center to conduct a music healing challenge program with 
								support from Community Chest of Korea. We strengthened support for orchestra there, and we set the goal that 15 members can play 
								the instruments. After 1 year, they could play the instruments by their ability and talent. Also, their teamwork and pride were 
								increased. The members collaborated with the youth or￾chestra, and they were invited to 6 outdoor events, so they showed their talents.
