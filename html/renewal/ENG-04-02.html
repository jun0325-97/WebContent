								<p>There are many people who do not get proper education and have trouble with getting a job and social life. As a result, their lives are severely 
								difficult.<br>So, Community Chest of Korea provides a customized education project to overcome their difficulty. We support scholarship, tuition, job 
								training, self-reliance education, understanding culture and language to improve the self-reliance ability. </p>

							<h4 class="h4">‘We can work and study again’ Hope Plan</h4>
							<p class="mgt-s">
								Community Chest of Korea realized unprivileged youth will suffer extreme poverty as adults, so we cooperat￾ed with Korean social welfare 
								associations for 3 years since December 2015 and provided integrated support with 11 hope plan local centers based on 3 STEPS of youth, 
								family and local community. As a result, we obtained good results for 3 years: 519 people entered higher school, 482 people got professional 
								certification, 195 people won various con￾tests, and 168 became employed. Although the Hope plan project was ended, 11 local centers still 
								maintain and ex￾pand the project with the public offices. Ms. Jung, who got hope from the Hope plan, was accepted to university. She said 
								“I want to be a person who helps people,” and she is still chasing her new dream.
							</p>
							
							<h4 class="h4">Improve the life of homeless</h4>
							<p class="mgt-s">
								Seoul vision training center has continually worked hard to improve the relationship between local residents who live near the homeless 
								rehabilitation facility where it supports homeless’ health care and treatment for alcohol￾ism. Community Chest of Korea supports this place 
								as woodwork room to improve the relationship between home￾less and local residents from January to December 2018. We operated the woodwork 
								room with woodwork agency of homeless who worked in the construction area, and we processed woodwork trial program and training for local 
								residents. Meanwhile, Yongdap-dong, where many motor component stores are located, emitted large quantities of wood palettes, but now the 
								palette replaced shelf and tools for pets through the agency upcycling education. As the old lumber was recycled household items, the life 
								of homeless changed thanks to the woodwork agency.
