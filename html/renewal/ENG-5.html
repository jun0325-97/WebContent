Since the collective outbreak in the area, the number of new cases has finally dropped to less than 30 a day over 50 days (on Apr. 10). Daegu also recorded zero new cases, but that does not preclude tasks to be addressed after the COVID-19 pandemic. What follows are some examples of the efforts made by private support foundations toward community restoration in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province amid the crisis.

                                                        At a time when a new civic system of preventive measures different from those implemented for SARS and MERS is called for, this organization provides COVID-19 volunteering guidelines (“untact” (no-contact) guidelines), informs people of the places in need of volunteers, and presents information about actual cases and real-life action plans. The e-mail newsletter also allows readers to share their own field situations and useful information, making it more interactive. The first newsletter was sent out in February to volunteers registered with the Korea Volunteer Center. (As of Apr. 10, seven newsletters have been released.)

                                                    What stood out in the private sector activities related to COVID-19 is that new experts and people, who are usually considered “data subjects,” or individuals identifiable through the information processed and therefore the subject of that information, provided the government with a variety of ideas for preventive measures. In the early days of social anxiety and uncertainty, people began using public data to create and share ways to overcome the crisis in creative ways. It is also noteworthy that the public sector quickly adopted the ideas from the private sector and shared transparently what was utilized and how at regular briefings. Let’s look at some of the cases where civic developers used public data available in Korea.

However, people may find such terms unfamiliar because they are not used much in daily life. Easier language is needed for all to understand. The Human and Communication AAC Center, an organization specializing in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), produced “Picture and Letter Boards for Communication” for the speech-impaired and distributed them to testing sites.<br />
                                                    Also, The Beautiful Foundation released a COVID-19 Booklet for 50,000 people with disabilities (a demographic vulnerable to infection) residing in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province in collaboration with an incorporated association named Community for the Disabled. Moreover, “Human Rights Foundation SARAM” offered support programs for human rights activists who stand by those with disabilities in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. What follows are activities that focused on increasing sensitivity to human rights in COVID-19 support programs.

                                                        In early March, Human and Communication AAC Center began producing “Picture and Letter Boards for Communication”. These boards are a supplementary communication tool that helps the hearing-impaired, those with developmental disabilities or brain lesion disorder, the elderly, and foreigners, all of whom may experience difficulty communicating with medical staff at testing sites. Users point to the pictures or letters to deliver their message while being tested for COVID-19. They have “O” (Yes) and “X” (No), and pictures representing symptoms, such as runny nose or fever and are provided to 124 testing sites in Gyeonggi Province in Korean, English, Chinese and Vietnamese.<br />Han Sun-kyung, director of the Center stated, “After learning through the media that foreigners and people with disabilities were finding it hard to get tested due to communication issues, we decided to work with our language therapists to make these picture and letter boards. […] We visited a testing site in Seoul’s Eunpyeong District to see how the testing is conducted and to demonstrate our boards and make them more effective. Feedback has included that the boards are useful not only for those with disabilities but also for those without, and that they are also used in sign language translation videos. This is all very rewarding.”<br />KCDC and the Ministry of Health and Welfare recognized the need for these boards. After going through a review process, they have been distributed to all COVID-19 testing sites and facilities for the disabled across the nation as well as relevant associations, including the Korea Organization for Parents of the Disabled.
