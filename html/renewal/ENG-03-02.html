								<p>Good Family program, launched in May 2016, invites families to take actions as philanthropists. 
								The families making a pledge to regularly give more than 20,000 KRW will receive the special plaque 
								of Good Family with a nice family photo and family motto included. As of 2018, there are 1,594 families 
								joined this nationwide program.</p>

							<p>
								Kwangsub Kim and Jooho Lee had their first kid in 2018 since marriage of 7 years, and they decided to join the good family 
								to share the thankful heart with others. Generally, they really loved kids, so after joining the good family, they donated 
								1 million KRW for kids who suffer from disability. In case of Mr. Kim, he has supported kids for 10years, and continually 
								participated in voluntary service for local community. They had really precious son after 7 years, so they said, “We will 
								raise our son who can make body and mind healthy to help and support unprivileged people, and they spoke of their aspiration 
								as 100th good family in Chungbuk.”
