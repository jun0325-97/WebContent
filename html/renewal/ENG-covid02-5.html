                                                    Rights Response Network (“the Network”) and urged that the measures
                                                    taken in relation to COVID-19 should be planned around protection of
                                                    human rights.
                                                    For instance, the Network pointed out that when a mass infection
                                                    occurred and spread around those who visited Itaewon in May, some
                                                    media outlets highlighted that gay clubs were visited first by the
                                                    person who tested positive, and then disclosed his address and
                                                    workplace. The Network argued that the disclosure of personal
                                                    information to prevent the spread of the virus should be at an
                                                    absolute minimum. It suggested that the government and media focus
                                                    on factors that affect the spread of infectious disease rather than
                                                    the identity of or relationship between those who catch it. The
                                                    Network also criticized the current method of disclosing
                                                    chronological movements of people with COVID-19, suggesting that
                                                    places and times can be made into data and disclosed in a way that
                                                    prevents the exposure of personal information. It also calls for
                                                    improvements so that measures for public health and the right of
                                                    assembly can coexist.

                                                    two meters from each other. It then pointed out that there presently
