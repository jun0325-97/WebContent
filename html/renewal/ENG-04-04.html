								<p>We need social support for the poeple in the socially vulnerable groups who are not able to afford to pay

							<h4 class="h4 mgb-xs">A good effort for seniors</h4>
							<p>
								Lots of seniors are living in Beop 1-dong in Dae￾jeon where it lagged behind. So, Mindeulre medical welfare social 
								association helps 500 seniors’ health and their qual￾ity of life through integrated care management system and tries 
								to improve health of local residences and community. Lately, the association improved seniors’ physical and men￾tal 
								health through making group ‘turtle health’ from ‘caring system’, and developed their self-caring ability. Moreover, 
								when seniors want to participate in health-related activity, we offered ‘health bill’, so we made the bill which can 
								be used as actual cash. As a result, the seniors’ health and life quality have been improved, and their cognitive ability, 
								de￾pression, social relationship also have been improved. 
							</p>
							
							<h4 class="h4 mgb-xs">Youth at risk, making healthy body and heart</h4>
							<p>
								Incheon Korea Youth Counseling & Welfare Insti￾tute with Community Chest of Korea operates psychological and physical 
								medical aid for 173 youth from November 2016. The youth at risk are already exposed to individual and en￾vironmental risk 
								from running away from home, special lar￾ceny, school assault, family poverty, low self-esteem, smok￾ing, drinking, and relying 
								on the internet and smartphones, so we need continuous concern and support through ‘youth network’. Whereupon, the institute
								 provided mental treat￾ment service to youth from various facilities who suffer from depression, anxiety, and self-injury to 
								 improve their mental health. Moreover, we support up to 2,000,000 KRW for medical expanse like dentist, internal medicine, 
								 surgery, and dermatology to youth’s healthy growth.
