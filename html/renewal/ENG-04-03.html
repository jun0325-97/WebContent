							<p>
								There are many neighbors in the community who cannot clean their house due to health issues, Dongsam social welfare center operates 3up
								(bundle up, clean up, cheer up) which is an integrated support program for com￾pulsive hoarding solution. We decided to need improvement
								of residential environment, so we performed improvement business for residential environment with related agencies. 
                                We provided the service cleaning, preventing, wall paper￾ing, and providing electric equipment to 5 families who have suffered respiratory
                                disorder, and from the hardships of life. Moreover, we performed residential education for local residences to help people to understand 
                                those with mental illnesses. We will continually keep this business through consistent monitoring, consulting, and medical care. 
							</p>
							
							<h4 class="h4 mgb-xs">Youth’s dream is newly designed with culture and art</h4>
							<p>
								The public art prism became associated with Beobwon-eup, Paju in 2016. Many US armies were sta￾tioned when Korean War so, there are many 
								red-light district located in Beobwon-eup, Paju. Now all red-light district are closed, but there were 5 places still opened in 2016. 
								So, Paju community tried and performed city reconstruction business which change from the red-light district to “culture and art district”. 
								So now, the village becomes ‘Culture cre￾ation village’ and the public art prism tried to do the best for new cultural settlement in the village. 
								So, 144 high school students and local residences participated in the project for 2 to 3 times per week, and now they gradually resolved the issue.
