                                                    The first COVID-19 case in Korea was reported on Jan. 20, 2020. The number of confirmed cases increased exponentially after a community infection occurred in Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu. However, as a result of intensive measures against the epidemic, active patient management, and all-out social distancing efforts by the public, the increase rate began slowing down. After recording a peak of 813 per-day new confirmed cases on Feb. 18, the number has gradually decreased, resulting in 10,537 confirmed cases in total as of Apr. 13. (Total tested: 518,743; positive: 2.1%; deceased: 217; recovered: 7,447; undergoing treatment: 2,873)

                                                        The idea of a drive-through screening system came from Kim Jin-yong, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Incheon Medical Center, which treated the first COVID-19 patient in Korea. It was first implemented in Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital in Daegu, followed by Yeungnam University Medical Center, also in Daegu, before going nationwide. Field worker input was taken into consideration, and as a result, the safety of both medical staff and patients was ensured while testing increased in speed.

On Feb. 23, the alert was raised again to the highest “Red” level (Level 4, warning) and the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters (CDSCHQ) was established, to be led by the Prime Minister towards ensuring pan-governmental control.
