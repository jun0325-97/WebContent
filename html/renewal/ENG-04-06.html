							<p class="mgt-s">
								Male seniors who live alone have increased but welfare services for them in the community are not enough. Most of them only 
								spend their time doing the same thing at senior community center. So, Shiyeong welfare center per￾formed the project for male 
								seniors who had trouble with cooking, cleaning, and laundry. The population of male se￾niors who live alone has increased but 
								welfare services for them in the community are insufficient. So, Shiyeong wel￾fare institution by supporting of Community Chest
								of Korea performed ‘Special men project the program to strengthen self-reliance for male seniors who live alone.’ Furthermore, 
                                we performed eating habit education, living management, and health care service. As a result, seniors’ living satis￾faction 
                                increased more 35.9%, and they got confidence through positive and autonomous activities, so they could better communicate 
                                with the community.

							<h4 class="h4">Outreach service</h4>
							<p class="mgt-s">In partnership with 30 agencies, Dangjin Commu￾nity Welfare Association operated mobile welfare centers at 6 
							communities where had service access issues. The most popular service for seniors was the medical aid ser￾vice, Dangin health 
							center, nursing department of Shinsung university and Seosan health center were participated in the service, and they performed 
							various kinds of medical services. Moreover, recreation group members donated their talent to show various cultural concert, 
							nail polish art, and calligraphy. Also we provided customized experiential program for local kids and youth like career experience 
							and photo study. Also, we provided senior abuse prevention campaign and life support service to improve various social issues.
