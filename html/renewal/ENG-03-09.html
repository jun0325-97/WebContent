								<p>The Korea Donor Advised Fund (KDAF) is a major giving program helping donors enjoy the benefit of running a foundation without 
								creating ones. As it fully reflects donors’ wishes and advices to operate the fund and customize the community project, many individuals 
								and companies have shown interests. Bongjin Kim, CEO of Woowa Brothers, made the largest gift of 5 billion KRW for this program in March 
								2018. </p>

								Bongjin Kim, Founder/CEO of Woowa Brothers, made a gift of 5 billion KRW to Community Chest of Korea on March 8, 2018. It was followed by 
								his remarks made on October 2017, that he wants to cash out 10 billion KRW from his asset and give to CCK over the next 3 years, aim￾ing to 
								provide scholarships to children and youths from low￾income families. The donor explored to establish his own foundation at first. However, 
								he finally decided to give for the Korea Donor Advised Fund as it will save unnecessary administrative cost and benefit more people in needs. 
								CEO of Midcampus Co. Byoungcheol Shin and former CEO of NAVER Sangheon Kim donated each 1 and 3 billion KRW, so in total 54 billion KRW has 
								been accumulated.
