								of disabled rights. Uiwang handicapped welfare center made project to improve the education of the dis￾abled right and its 
								awareness the disabled webtoon author training project “3 cuts to show me”, so the stories of the webtoon are about the life 
								and experiences of the disabled. While processing the project, all participants shared con￾cerns about the problems of the 
								disabled which everyone experiences. Moreover, the disabled could participate as assistant authors, so they accomplished 
								the self-help. As a result, total 62 episodes were upload on the web by the dis￾abled who finished the education 30 times. 
								Moreover, the disabled could actively express their own opinions, so their life changed from passive to active.
