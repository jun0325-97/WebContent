										Community Chest of Korea, launched in 1998, has been a catalyst for change in the Korean society based on citizens’ voluntary 
										participation for the past 20 years. And we make every effort to promote philanthropy, show measurable outcomes, and lead innovations
										 to grow with various partners, and thus make differences in the community. Our symbol, “The Fruit of Love” represents myself, my 
										 family, and neighbors. It means that we will build a caring society together.

									<p>
										On Dec 21, 2018, during Community Chest of Korea's annual campaign, the special letter arrived “Postbox of Love” 
										located at Thermometer of Love. There were total 100 stacks 50,000 KRW in the envelope. We could not idenntify the 
										donor as there was no indication. As such, there are many anonymous donors sharing their caring hearts for the society 
										via Community Chest of Korea. We were also excited about the news on the special gift made in Haenam village.
										That is, the children in Haenam childrens’ center donated money which they collected for 1 year. This shelter was once at 
										risk for closing as it did not meet the criteria for business operation. However, thanks to many citizens including Moon 
										Geun-young, the actress, it got over the challenging time and remained as precious home for children in needs., Children 
										were always thankful for what they received, and thus saved their stipends to give back to the community for the past 10years. 
										Children learned about joy of giving and became philanthropists with high level achievements.
