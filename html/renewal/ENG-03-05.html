							<p>
								Self-publishing corporation Isonomia which joined the Good Rights on September 4, 2018 has donated 5% of the sales of humanity 
								series “Wisdom of human genius.” CEO of Isonomia Hyemi Ku said donation through selling books is very special because readers 
								can get wisdom of life and help someone through reading a book at the same time. In the Tumblbug crowd funding platform, Isonomia 
								urged many readers participate in the event, and it was well received in the readers through funding from WHY of Virginia Wolf and 
								Good Will of Kant. So, now Isonomia has published books titled Hypnotist, Happiness of Others, and Sonata and is participating in more
								 donation activity. Since then, the book ‘Wisdom of human genius’ which was pro￾duced by Isonomia is being published with the printing logo 
                                of Community Chest of Korea on the cover.
