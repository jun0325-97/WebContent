							<p class="mgt-s">The life social welfare institution performed the community program “Family” to reduce loneliness of se￾niors 
							who live alone at permanent leasing apartments, and to reinforce their social network. 49% of seniors are living alone at home 
							in the region of the center. So, their social network and communication are lacking in comparison with their deep loneliness. 
							So, the institution made a chance on rooftop of the institution to communicate each other like cultivating farm and eating together. 
							Participants said “we had no friends so felt depression from loneliness before, but now we are happy to have new friends.” One of 
							them said, “I am really happy to make friends here.” </p>
